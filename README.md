Inferential Statistical Analysis of Customer Purchase Behavior

* Overview:
This project uses statistical tests to check if common beliefs about how people shop—based on their age and gender—are actually true, using real customer data.

* Main Results:
  
    1. Men aged 18–25 do not spend exactly ₹10,000 on average.
 
    2. The number of men spending more than ₹10,000 is not the same between ages 18–25 and 26–35.
 
    3. 35% of women are not the ones spending more than ₹10,000—it’s more or less.
 
    4. The average purchase between men and women (age 18–25) is not the same.

* Business Conclusion:
  
    Companies should not fully trust assumptions based on age or gender. Instead, they should use data* based decisions for better marketing, offers, and customer targeting.
